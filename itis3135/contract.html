        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p> I, Nora R. Miller agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2025, ITIS3135, Front-End Web App Development with my instructor, 
            Professor D.I. von Briesen. </p>
        <p>I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, 
            and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, 
            not logins or showing up for class. </p>
        <p>As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it is 
            possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, 
            and will not cut and paste code except where I have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.</p>
