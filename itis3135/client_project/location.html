        <!--Provides information about Wes' shooting locations, and links to a few previous locations and venues-->
        <p>Wes' passion first took off when he came to Charlotte, so the city of Charlotte is of course the main location Wes operates in.
            He can also be found in the Research Triangle Park area, otherwise recognized as the Raleigh-Durham area, 
            especially during the summer and winter breaks between semesters.
        </p>
        <p>A few of his previous locations include around <a target="_blank" href="https://www.charlotte.edu/"><strong>UNC Charlotte's campus,
        </strong></a>the<a target="_blank" href="https://lovinlifemusicfest.com/"><strong>Lovin' Life Music Festival</strong></a>in Charlotte,
            and the<a target="_blank" href="https://hopscotchmusicfest.com/"><strong>Hopscotch Music Festival</strong></a>in Raleigh, though he is open to other locations and venues as well.
