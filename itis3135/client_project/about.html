        <div class="introduction">
        <p>Wes Packham is a Junior Computer Science student at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. After joining the Niner Times
            back in 2024, Wes became interested in pursuing photography in his spare time. From there, his interest bloomed into passion, and 
            he soon started covering events and taking photos for Niner Times usage.
        </p>
        <p>Ever since, his passion has only grown. To him, it's very much a hobby that he wishes to continue to improve, and the best way to 
            do that is by practicing as much as possible. By serving his local community and gaining hands-on experience taking differently 
            styled photos for a variety of different occasions, he hopes to expand his skills along with his portfolio.
