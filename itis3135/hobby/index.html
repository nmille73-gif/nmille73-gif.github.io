            <h2>What is reading as a hobby?</h2>
            <p>Reading is a life-long skill that once finally understood, becomes so ingrained in life that it occurs
                as subconsciously and easily as breathing or walking. We spend a fair amount of time in school reading,
                being graded on our comprhension of ancient texts or the meaning of a figure of speech, but it can be so much more than that.
            </p>
            <p>Reading for fun is an opportunity to take a deep-dive into a concept of interest or a topic covered a million times.
                If you know what you like, you can stick with it and be entertained over and over again, but you can also spread
                your wings and pick up something new. Once you take away the "required" aspect of reading, you can discover what you like 
                on your own and thoroughly enjoy these worlds of literary genius.

            <h2>Who reads and who should you read?</h2>
            <p>My name is Nora and I absolutely love to read. Ever since I first learned to read, I have always loved picking up a book
            and relaxing in the story. I have always loved reading, and even though college is an incredibly busy time for me to balance
            school work, a social life, and the drama of being in your 20's, it's been a hobby that I've been able to come back to and carry
            with me throughout.
            </p>
            <p>A few of my favorite authors who have really kept my attention and love for the hobby include: Stephen King - one of the greatest
                authors of horror I've ever encountered, Emily Henry - she churns out romance novels that don't feel too cheap nor too cutesy by 
                maintaining excellent plots, and of course this list would not be complete without mentioning my childhood favorite, Suzanne Collins - 
                author of the <em>Hunger Games</em> series.

        <section id="when" class="content-section">
            <h2>When is the best time to read?</h2>
            <p>Perhaps my favorite aspect of reading is the fact that you can read literally any time. If it's a nice fall day outside
                and you want to enjoy the weather, go read. If you are stuck in a long car ride and you don't get carsick, read. If you're
                ready to go to bed but your mind just won't quit, read. It's versatile, flexible, and good for you.
            </p>
            <p>Over the summer, I had plenty of free time to spend with friends, going on trips, or pursuing other hobbies of mine, but here 
                in college, I don't have nearly as much time on my hands. Now, I'll capture a stray 30 minutes here, an hour there, fully depending
                on my schedule, my energy levels, and most obviously, my boredom.

        <section id="where" class="content-section">
            <h2>Where should you read?</h2>
            <p>Determing where you can read is almost as easy as when: anywhere. If I'm reading a very good book, the kind
                where I genuinely do not want to put it down, I can sit down and read that book so easily, no matter where I am. 
                Other times, if it's a novel that I haven't really gotten into, maybe it's a classic from 100 years ago or something 
                so science-fiction that the world-building has lost me, then I need to be more intentional.
            </p>
            <p>In general, I recommend and a quiet space without many distractions. Libraries are great, but also your bedroom, a hammock outside,
                whatever makes you feel comfertable and able to focus. Reading shouldn't feel challenging, and if it does, try changing your environment,
                OR worse-case scenario, pick up a different book.
            </p>

        <section id="how" class="content-section">
            <h2>How do I get started reading?</h2>
            <p>The best way to start reading is to just go for it. Truely. I have read my fair share of bad books. Ones
                where I couldn't get into them, one's where I really didn't like the main character, the list goes on. Sometimes
                I can tough it out, but other times I just need to find something that genuinly grabs my interest.
            </p>
            <p>A few resources that helped me get started were GoodReads and my local library! GoodReads is an app that allows you to track
                your reading goals, your current progress in a book, and allows you to rate and review the book. Additionally, it recommends you
                books based on what you've read, your interests, and even what your friends are reading too. At your local library, you can 
                also ask a librarian for recommendations or take a look a the library catalog to see what's popular.

        <section id="why" class="content-section">
            <h2>Why read?</h2>
            <p>For people like me who seriously enjoy reading, the answer could be so many things. Reading is relaxing,
                it provides escapism the way a good video game or movie can. It's calming, unless it's a thrilling climax,
                so you can take a break in a book for a bit in the middle of a busy day. It's also good for you, it increases
                your vocabulary, critical thinking skills, and reading and writing.
            </p>
            <p>At the end of the day, personal enjoyment is what it comes down to. Consuming what you love and find interesting 
                is always the goal, and when you find it, see where it takes you.
