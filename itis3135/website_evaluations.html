        <p>CRAP Design Principles</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Contrast: The primarily white background with black font does have ample contrast, but so does the dark green font also used throughout. </li>
            <li>Repetition: The layout of each row of books plus their scroll bar is identical, keeping it consistent.</li>
            <li>Alignment: The left-hand side has a navigation bar, and the entire right-hand side is book selection, all of which are evenly aligned with appropriate margins.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Book options are grouped based on different categories that are clearly separated, as is the navigation bar on the left-hand side from the rest of the site.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><a href="https://www.childrensinternationalworkshop.com/Web_FONTS/Web_FONTS_code.html#:~:text=Web_FONTS,font%2Dfamily%3A%20papyrus%3B">Childrens International Workshop - Web Fonts Site</a></h3>
        <p>This website displays the information on how to include Papyrus, and other fonts from their website in your HTML code.</p>
        <p>CRAP Design Principles</p>
        <ul> 
            <li>Contrast: Contrast is high, but the background is a simple white and the font is a simple black.</li>
            <li>Repetition: Not a strong sense of repition other than the borders in between sections.</li>
            <li>Alignment: Everything is left-aligned with absolutely no margin.</li>
            <li>Proximity: Elements are group into sections, but there isn't adequate spacing in between individual elements.</li>
        </ul>
