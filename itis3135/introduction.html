        <p>Hello everyone, I'm Nora! A few things about me are that I love reading - especially Stephen King novels,  I thoroughly enjoy traveling when given the opportunity, and I'm the treasurer of UNCC's Culinary Club, so I spend an incredible amount of my time cooking and eating. I am currently attempting to break a caffeine addiction, so we'll see how that goes.

        <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Background:</b>I was born in New Haven, CT, but have spent over 18 years of my life in Apex, NC.</li>
            <li><b>Professional Background:</b>I held a Cybersecurity Internship at Fidelity this past summer!</li>
            <li><b>Academic Background:</b> I am a junior studying computer science with a concentration in cybersecurity and a minor in French.</li>
            <li><b>Primary Computer:</b>I use an Apple, MacOS, laptop, primarily at my apartment.</li>
            <li><b>Courses I'm Taking & Why:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>ITIS3135 - Front-End Web Application Development: </b>It is required first and foremost, but I am also interested in learning more about front-end development.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC3146 - Introduction to Operating Systems: </b>It is required, but from what I understand the information and knowledge bases from this course are highly valuable in my future field.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC3155 - Software Engineering: </b>It is required, but hopefully I can expand my fluency in many coding languages and add it to my resume.</li>
                    <li><b>ITSC3688 - Computers and Their Impact on Society: </b>It is required BUT I do think that communication skills are highly valuable and incredibly important to have confidence in.</li>
                    <li><b>MATH2164 - Matrices and Linear Algebra: </b>It is required but will hopefully put me in the right flow of thinking when it comes to solving simila</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>Funny/Interesting Item to Remember Me by: </b>I am sort of terrified of Scandinavian architecture/interior design. I cannot fully explain why, maybe I was traumatized by watching Midsommar a few years ago, but I find walking into IKEA deeply unsettling.</li>
